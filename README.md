# About me

I'm a 2nd year Global MSPPM student and I'm currently based at the Australia campus. Prior to CMU, I worked at the USEPA, in the Office of Pesticide Programs and the Office of the CFO. For my internship, I worked with the UN Development Programme's Global Programme on Nature for Development developing course content for the ‘Learning for Nature’ platform, supporting the Spatial Planning team’s capacity building workshops and performing research on nature-based solutions and water policies. I would like to continue to work in the environmental field after graduation, preferably on a global policy scale, with a focus on sustainable development and natural resource management in developing nations.

# What I hope to learn
I am interested in learning how to apply GIS in my future work to perform analyses and meet various client needs in the areas of work I'm interested in - public and envrionmntal health. I also want to learn how to utilize GIS and other statistical softwares I am learning while at Heinz (SAS, Python, and R).
