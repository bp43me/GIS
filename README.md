This is my portfolio for the Advanced GIS class.

# About me

I'm a 2nd year Global MSPPM student andI'm current based at the Australia campus. Prior to CMU, I worked at the USEPA, in the Office of Pesticide Programs and the Office of the CFO. I would like to continue to work in the environmental field after graduation, preferably on a global policy scale, with a focus on sustainable development and natural resource management in developing nations.

# What I hope to learn
I am also interested in learning how to apply GIS
