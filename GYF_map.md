# Greening Youth Foundation Custom Google Map

[Greening Youth Foundation](https://gyfoundation.org/) is a non-profit based in Atlanta, Georgia with a mission to "engage under-represented youth and young adults, while connecting them to the outdoors and careers in conservation". The photo that was selected to create the color palette for their custom map utilzed the earth tone colors found in their promotional post for their HBCU Internship Initiative (see below).
